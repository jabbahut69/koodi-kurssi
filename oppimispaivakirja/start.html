                An archway carves an entrance to the Sainsbury grounds. Outsiders are rarely able to catch a glimpse of the true form of the castle due to the absurdely high walls surrounding it. You are one of the lucky ones, you think to yourself as you take a wary step inside.
                Your invitation had arrived only a day before the unfortunate news of the sudden death of the young baron, the previous owner of the estate. Your appointment had, however, not been cancelled, so you decided to take the opportunity you had been awaiting for a long time. <i>I hope I'm not intruding the family in mourning.</i>

                You had not been able to sleep well the night before due to your excitement, so you had got up and made your way to the castle much too early for your appointment. There is no one yet to receive you. You are too nervous to stay still, so you make way to the castle at your own accord. Fortunately, you had been able to acquire a map of the grounds from the university library to help you navigate to the best locations for you endeavor.
