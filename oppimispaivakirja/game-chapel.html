        <h2>THE CHAPEL</h2>
            
            <p class="first-p">
                The Sainsbury Castle is rumored to have a most interesting Chapel. It is said the crypt contains the remains of St. Bede the Venerable, a renowned monk and scholar, but you have yet to have heard any real evidence for the claim. Regardless, the architecture alone makes the building worth a visit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The ancient wooden door creaks as you open it to reveal the dim-lit room. Some candles are burning by the altar, slightly flickering for the draft. You marvel at the decorative carvings on the stone walls and the intricate statues depicting knights and lords of the olden days. It is not an inviting space, per say. The stuffy air and long dark shadows give the room a feel of unease. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You are startled by a sound of fabric being ruffled by the seats next to the altar. There is a short figure dressed in all black blending so well in the shadows you have to do a double take to make sure you are looking at an actual person. It is a young lady you shortly recognize as the youngest sister of the late Baron of Sainsbury form pictures you have seen in the magazines.

                <div class="list-p">
                    <p>
                        You feel it would be impolite not to announce yourself now that you are both aware of each other. <q>Good morning. I apologize for the intrusion.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The young lady turns to you her face stern with heavy eyebags under her eyes making her look much older than in the pictures you had seen. <q>Who are you?</q> she asks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You search your pockets for the invitation. <q>I'm from the University, department of entomology. I was invited toâ€”</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>Alright.</q> The young lady turns away back to staring at the altar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A heavy silence fills the chapel. <q>My condolences for your loss. I will be on my way.</q> you say and take a step towards the door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>No, you should finish whatever you came here to do. I was about to leave anyway.</q> Lady Sainsbury stands up looking down and starts to make her way to the door. You think it's quite striking someone her age is praying at the chapel at such early hours of the day. She must be truely devastated for the death of her brother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You want to help somehow but can't think of anything to say. <q>It will get better.</q> you blurt out as lady Sainsbury walks past you. She looks at you tiredly. You instantly regret saying anything. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>What if I was to blame? Then would it get easier, too?</q> she asks, but it doesn't really sound like a question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>It is quite normal to feel that way, but how could any of it possibly be your fault?</q> You smile weakly at the young lady. You know how it feels like to lose a loved one, so you understand how she might feel. Being so young, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>Tsk.</q> Lady Sainsbury snorts at you and leaves the chapel.

                        A quick browse through the names on the tombs bared no sign of St. Bede the Venerable. There is, however, a wooden door to your left which could lead to a more hidden crypt somewhere, but you haven't the nerves to try opening the door. The location of the remains of St. Bede the Venerable's remains to you, a mystery.
