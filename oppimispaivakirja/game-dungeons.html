                When an opportunity to visit an old castle's dungeons arise, one does not refrain. Shivering as the local ghost stories are, you risk the possibility of meeting a specter to sneak a look at the infamous prison cells. <i>If only these walls could talk.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The air feels thick and musty in the underground halls. It's almost sticking to your skin. The ceiling hangs low, and the room is lit by stained oil lanterns well beyond their best years. The atmosphere contrasts heavily with the opulent castle and the open grounds outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                To your startlement, a soft whispering echoes from the walls as you ponder the fates of the poor souls once serving their punishment at the very room. You discover the source as not a phantom, but a pair of maids locked in a secretive conversation a few pillars over. They haven't noticed you yet.

                    <p>
                        You creep close enough to barely be able to hear a low insisting voice of one of the maids. <q>... it just doesn't add up, I'm telling you. She was not the kind of person to go around stealing jewels.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>Well, you never know with people, do you? Why else would she have disappeared in the dead of night? Money does curious things to people, it does.</q> the other one answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>But think about how it all came to light. It was Lady Sainsbury who blamed it on miss Chatsworth and they didn't exactly get along.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can hear the second maid sighing. <q>But miss Chatsworth <i>was</i> the only person to go to Lady Sainsbury's room that evening besides the Lady herself. That much is clear to everyone. And now miss Chatsworth's run off somewhere.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>I guess it is quite suspicious...</q> The maids fall silent.

                    <p>
                        <q>Is that a dead rat?</q>

                    <p>
                        <q>I'm <i>not</i> cleaning that up.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>We never saw a thing.</q> You hear hurried footsteps as the maids scurry away from their nasty discovery around the corner and through some door hidden from your sight.

                        Any traces of the previous inhabitants of the cells have been long since cleared out. And perhaps it's for the best. The heavy bars on the drafty windows and sodden murky floor tiles make it obvious it must have been a most misfortunate fate to have had to lived there. A chill creeps down you neck accompanied with a high pitched whistling in your ears and you turn around fast to see what had caused it.
